In general, I have to fix the sidebar structure. 
First of all, there are some JavaScript [object object] errors. 

Next, the taxonomy inputs are too big and clunky. I need a compact chip input that shows the selected parts, possibly not above but inside the input. I'm not sure about this because when there are more tags, having them above is actually good, but it takes up too much space. So, maybe we should add tabs in the sidebar; there should be tabs for tags and so on. Another thing is that, since you have to scroll to see comments, comments should probably be in another tab because they are taking up too much space. I don't know, and maybe there will be a switch between views: view in tabs and view, you know, all in one that you scroll. I'm not sure about it yet.

of course actual woring and teisng of functionaly and comention wiht apui shoudl be also done
