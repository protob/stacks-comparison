TanStack Query 

    Use it for all data fetching, caching, syncing, and mutation handling against your REST API.

    It will handle server state efficiently with automatic cache updates, retries, background syncing, optimistic updates, and cache invalidation.

    This removes a big chunk of manual boilerplate managing loading/error states and cache consistency for API calls.

Keep note thast i want also to keep zustand so  tnastakc qeury +zustand

TanStack Router 

    If your app needs client-side routing with type-safe route params, nested layouts, and loaders, use TanStack Router.

    It nicely integrates with Query for data loading on routes, making your routing and data-fetching model more declarative.
